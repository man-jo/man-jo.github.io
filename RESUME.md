* Integrated transcriptomics and immunopeptidomics data to generate target libraries; implemented automated reporting.
* Developed long-read RNAseq pipeline for alternative splicing discovery & quantification based on IsoSeq3 & SQANTI.
* Coordinated cross-team efforts as work package lead for immunopeptidomics target mining; prepared scientific deliverables and presentations.

#### Biomarker Biostatistician - Sanofi / Ividata
*2018 - 2021, Paris*

* Led biomarker analyses in phase 2/3 trials (Sarilumab, Dupilumab, SAR440340) using RNAseq, SNP microarray, and proteomics (olink): statistical analysis plan authoring & implementation with R, oversight of CROs, preparation of deliverables.
* Served as biomarker biostatistician and machine learning advisor in several R&D projects in oncology, cardiology, multiple sclerosis.
* Developed a shiny app for interactive reporting of omics biomarker data analysis.
* Participated in the development of R trainings “Introduction to R” and “Graphs in R” for Sanofi statisticians & programmers.

#### Clinical Biostatistician - Sanofi / Ividata
*2016 - 2018, Paris*

* GMA Study biostatistician for phase 3b clinical trial (Alirocumab, hypercholesterolemia): authoring SAP and TLFs specs, coordination with CRO & clinical team to prepare of deliverables (KRM, CSR), supervision & QC of CRO’s activities.
* Biostatistician for the Alirocumab publication program: performed data mining and post-hoc analyses across 14 pooled clinical trials to support the development of abstracts, posters, and peer-reviewed publications.

#### Biostatistician & Computational Genomics Scientist - Pharnext
*2012 - 2015, Paris*

* Built a workflow for GWAS data imputation and analysis to discover disease-specific genomic alterations.
* Designed SAP for Phase II/III clinical trials with adaptive designs, interim futility and power analysis, procedures for multiple endpoints. Meta-analysis of clinical trials.
* Conducted biomarker statistical analysis for in-house clinical trials, including reportings and presentations for internal and external stakeholders (scientific & business).
* Authored abstracts, posters, and peer-reviewed articles.

#### Biostatistics & Bioinformatics research engineer - Institut Curie / INSERM U900
*2009 - 2012, Paris*
